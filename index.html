            <P>be simple and responsive to everyone, but make sure you don't be a fool. And don't love your life becouse is perfect, only love it if you are who you truly say you are. my everyday life have aways been to hurt people with truth and not to make them happy with lies,dying with the bitter truth is better of living extravagance life of lies. </P>
